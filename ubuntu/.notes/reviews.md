- I mentioned about how my team in `Benchmarks` wouldn't say anything for two days in a pull request. I suggested that we just set a time limit and consider that as an implied _acceptance_. Josh overreacted and took that to mean I was complaining, bringing me with him to my coworkers' office to discuss it with them. The result was that I ended up looking like a _snitch_, i.e. someone who complains to higher-ups about co-workers for the smallest concerns.
